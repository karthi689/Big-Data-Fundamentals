# Big-Data-Fundamentals
A introductory on Big Data Fundamentals

1) What makes Data "Big Data"? <br />
    A data set is considered "big data" when it is **too big** or **complex** to be **stored** or **analyzed** by **traditional data systems**.<br />
  Big data isn't just a lot of data â€” it's also a lot of complex data that cannot otherwise be stored in traditional databases.<br />

2) Types of Data?<br />
(i) **Structured Data**<br />
    Data that conforms to a strict format (schema). This type of data is typically stored in rows and columns like a traditional database, as it can be easily mapped to predefined fields. Only makes up about 10% of all data.<br />
(ii) **Semi-Structured Data**<br />
    Data that doesn't reside in a traditional database but has some level of organization. With some processing, semi-structured data may be stored in a traditional databasebut couldprove challenging.<br />
CSV, YAML and JSON are good examples of semi-structured data.Most NoSQL databases are considered semi-structured. Only represents about 10% of all data.<br />
(iii) **Unstructured Data**<br />
     Data that cannot fit neatly into a database, as there is no logical schema or format that can flatten thedata intotextual rows and columns. It can be about anything: text, images, audio, etc. Even pieces of data that have some level of internal structure can still be considered unstructured. Represents about 80% of all data.<br />

3) The 3 V's<br />
(i) **Volume**: The quantity of the data<br />
(ii) **Velocity**: How quickly the data is produced<br />
(iii) **Variety**: How diverse the data is<br />

Extra 4 V's<br />
(iv) **Veracity**: The reliability of the data source<br />
(v) **Variability**: How consistent the data values are<br />
(vi) **Visualization**: How easily the data can be visualized<br />
(vii) **Value**: The derivability of value from the data.<br />

4) What is Machine Learning?<br />
A category of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to analyze data, learn from the data, and then make inferences about the data.<br />
Mark email as spam or not spam, facial recognition, anomaly detection, credit scoring, etc are good examples of machine learning.<br />

5) What is Data Analytics?<br />
**Process** and **analyze** data sets to **model** and **communicate** answers to specific questions with **actionable data**.<br />
**Goals**<br />
(i) Provide solutions to known unknowns<br />
(ii) Answer specific questions<br />
**Skills**<br />
Statistics, Computer science, AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc.)<br />

6) What is Data Science?<br />
A **multi-disciplinary** field that specializes in exposing **insights** from **large data sets**.<br />
**Goals**<br />
(i) Understand phenomena<br />
(ii) Explore unknown unknowns<br />
(iii) To identify right questions to ask.<br />
(iv) Find better ways to analyze data.<br />
**Skills**<br />
Statistics, Advanced Mathematics, Computer science, AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc.), Data analysis<br />
