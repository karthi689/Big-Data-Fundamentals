A introductory on Big Data Fundamentals

What makes Data "Big Data"? <br />
A data set is considered "big data" when it is **too big** or **complex** to be **stored** or **analyzed** by **traditional data systems**.<br />
Big data isn't just a lot of data â€” it's also a lot of complex data that cannot otherwise be stored in traditional databases.<br />

Types of Data?
**Structured Data**<br />
Data that conforms to a strict format (schema). This type of data is typically stored in rows and columns like a traditional database, as it can be easily mapped to predefined fields. Only makes up about 10% of all data.<br />
&nbsp;
**Semi-Structured Data**<br />
Data that doesn't reside in a traditional database but has some level of organization. With some processing, semi-structured data may be stored in a traditional databasebut couldprove challenging.<br />
CSV, YAML and JSON are good examplesof semi-structured data.Most NoSQL databases are considered semi-structured. Only represents about 10% of all data.<br />
&nbsp;
**Unstructured Data**<br />
Data that cannot fit neatly into a database, as there is no logical schema or format that can flatten thedata intotextual rows and columns. It can be about anything: text, images, audio, etc. Even pieces of data that have some level of internal structure can still be considered unstructured. Represents about 80% of all data.<br />
